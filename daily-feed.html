						At QuintoAndar, I worked in a Growth squad whose goal was to:
					</p>

					<p class="icon-highlight">
						Increase users' conversion to visit scheduling to the listings available at the site
					</p>

					<p class="resume-text">
						We specifically focused on strategies of user activation and notification at our renting platform and for that, we gathered data on the performance of our main communication channel with users at that stage of the funnel: e-mails.
						<br><br>
						Being aware that are different patterns of home searching, we categorized some usage profiles according with our quantitative data to draw an efficient communication plan for each one on them.
