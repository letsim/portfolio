						Resume
					</h4>

						At QuintoAndar, I worked in a Growth squad whose goal was to:
					</p>

					<p class="icon-highlight">
						Increase users' conversion to visit scheduling to the listings available at the site
					</p>

					<p class="resume-text">
						We specifically focused on strategies of user activation and notification at our renting platform and for that, we gathered data on the performance of our main communication channel with users at that stage of the funnel: e-mails.  
						<br><br>
						Being aware that are different patterns of home searching, we categorized some usage profiles according with our quantitative data to draw an efficient communication plan for each one on them.

					Problem

				<p>How might we access users who need to find listings that fit their search with urgency? Meanwhile, how might we engage the user who doesn't have urgency and/or is searching on other real estate platforms as well?</p>

							Business perspective
						</h4>

						<p>
							<b>E-mails:</b> according to our quantitative analysis, data points recommendation e-mails as the major source of scheduled bookings, exceeding retargetting communications.  
							<br><br>
							<b>Reach:</b> we've been sending around 10.000 e-mails per day to all our renter audience and had a high opening rate, which means good visibility and potential.  
							<br><br>
							<b>Segmentation:</b> Our e-mails are segmentend by recommendation algorithms in development by the squad. These algorithms returned similar listings to the ones that users had already interacted with in the previous days, but we began studying wich interactions were most valuable and how to deliver that similarities.

							User perspective
						</h4>

						<p>
							<b>In the product:</b> similar listings' session is highly accessed by renters in their sessions at our platform, this indicates that users search for options alike the ones that sparkled interest in them.
							<br><br>
							<b>Market patterns:</b> also, it's an already stablished pattern (specially between e-commerces) sending e-mails with content recommendations to bring back users to the site.

							”How can I have more options without having the trouble of searching the whole site?”
