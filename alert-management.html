							<p class="resume-text">
								One of the opportunities my squad at QuintoAndar was exploring was the power of notifications to nurture leads throughout their home searching journey. The platform already had a feature that enabled users to program an alert that would notify them through email when a new listing that could match their filters came up on the site. As we noticed in our analysis, its users were generally more prone to convert, which means that they were more likely to book visits at listings in the site.</p>
						</section>

						<section class="coluna-direita">
							<p class="resume-text">
								Even so, it was not the majority of users at the site that would interact with the feature. As we saw great potential to the conversion scope, we started to point out major problems in the experience surrounding it and began to experiment with small improvements that would give more control and visibility to its users.

					Problem
				</h4>

				<p>How might we bring awareness to the alerts’ feature and its value? How might we turn it into a more user-friendly tool to help them to find the ideal listing as soon as possible?</p>

				
				<section class="dual-maroto">
					<section class="coluna-esquerda">
						<h4 class="project-title perspectives">
							Business perspective
						</h4>

						<p>
							<span class="highlight">Engagement:</span> Users who have alerts have higher rates of visit booking than the ones that don't, but they are a minority. The feature is not restricted to logged users, allowing someone to create an alert just by inputting their email and that showed some adoption so far: a fraction of all not-logged users (tracked by their active sessions) had an average of 1-2 alerts programmed, while logged users had 2-3 linked to the emails. 
							<br><br>
							<span class="highlight">Communication:</span> The resulting listings would be sent once a day through email, one of our major contact points with users. Metrics showed that these emails had high open rates and click through rates.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section class="coluna-direita">
						<h4 class="project-title perspectives">
							User perspective
						</h4>

						<p>
							<span class="highlight">Previous research:</span> other teams had already experimented with the usability of the alert tool. We knew that it was not an easy-to-find feature in the interface altogether, but a few tests had shown us that the CTAs positioning, a new curious label for them and the use of the image of our dog mascot, Homes, could spike interest in the user and result in more clicks.
							<br><br>
							<span class="highlight">Control:</span> users could only know the alerts were working if they received emails to confirm its creation or with the search results. If they wanted to edit the alert, they could only create a new one. Their only possible action once it was created was to unsubscribe to all following emails, blocking the possibility of receiving them again in the future.
							<br><br>
							<span class="highlight">Purpose:</span> the alerts would work as a digital agent, searching for new listings for the users and sending the interesting ones to their emails.

						Solution

						<h4 class="project-title perspectives">
							Prototypes
						</h4>

						<p>We improved the alerts' feature by giving users a better control of it. We created a new area in the platform for Alert Management, easily acessible through navigation menus or the average search flow.</p>
						<img src="./img/logged-flow.png">

						<p>We kept the feature available for not-logged users, as it had a good adoption. When this type of user created an alert, we stored that data in his session and linked the parameters picked for that alert with his email. In spite of that, we decided to bring the management area as a way of activating those users, pointing some new value in logging in while also protecting his data, as now the alerts could also send results to his cellphone number and that kind of information could not be out in the open.</p>

							<section class="coluna-direita">
								<p>The card to create alerts now had a lot more information, informing the user of what the feature was for <span class="highlight">(1)</span>, how many alerts he had and the possibility of updating them intead of creating new ones, while also leading the user to the new management area <span class="highlight">(2)</span>, the filters applied to his current search that would compose the new alert, if he desired to create it anyway <span class="highlight">(3)</span>, his email <span class="highlight">(4)</span> and an opt-in so that he would receive new listings through his Whatsapp <span class="highlight">(5)</span>.The alert management area gave control of every alert ever creted for the user. He could remove it, edit its filters to match his actual search or update an already expired one. Following our search algorithms, every alert was active for 30 days but users would just stop receiving emails with results if that time was over, without ever knowing exaclty why. Now he could track its expiring date and take action, if necessary. </p>

						<!--colocar mais imagens aqui seria bom, as do fluxo ficaram mt pequenas-->

						<p>Finally, the new feature would be easily acessed by users right from the emails with their results, being a constant reminder that they could improve them by updating their alerts.</p>
