                <section class="process-description">
                    <p>We used <a class="external-link" href="https://articles.centercentre.com/why-ux-outcomes-make-better-goals-than-business-outcomes/">Jared Spool’s UX Outcomes</a> methodology to structure our collaboration. We started by <span class="highlight">gathering the team</span> working on an email integration to our software, which we were just about to release. While working with UX outcomes is great to guide us from the very start of feature development, it is also a strong resource at its final stages: defining them helps to organize artifacts that were produced during our exploration, definition and prototyping phases and forces the team to look at the priorities we chose to do our designs.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With two UX designers, a Product Manager and an Engineering Lead, we got back to <span class="highlight">analyze the current experience</span> our users had to go through. User journeys done during our early discovery days showed gaps that we could address with the integration. We had <span class="highlight">listed key frustrations</span> that our users had while interacting with email and those were validated through research we ended up doing further ahead. Fueling our analysis with user insight is crucial if we want to run a process that aims at providing real value to users.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In order to have a MVP defined, the team had prioritized those key frustrations and selected the ones we would provide solutions to. Going back to that prioritization, we regrouped those that ended up being covered by our prototypes and clustered them according to common themes. That made it easier to identify at least two different UX outcomes were needed.

                    <img src="./img/****.png"> <!--botar nome certo do arquivo-->

                    <p>The <span class="highlight">most compelling solutions</span> for these frustrations were, by then, already selected and included in our prototypes. With clear understanding of the journey we were impacting, we were ready to work on our UX outcomes drafts.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Crafting these drafts was naturally an iterative process. Our framework was:

                    <p>As a duo, we began brainstorming ideas on what to add to those gaps. After multiple rounds of trying different wording, we got to a couple of statements that seemed to rightfully describe the value we were adding to our product if done correctly. This was the moment to bring back our trio colleagues in order to get consensus on the final result and ideate on metrics that would show we were approaching our goal.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Spool's methodology illustrates <span class="highlight">success metrics</span> as the “finish line of the race” because they should mean we’ve achieved the goal we were aiming for. When a UX outcome is defined, there must be a clear indicative of what our success can look like and it should be measurable. It most likely means a multi-faceted change in users’ experiences, therefore we must have indicatives along the way of close we are to achieving that goal, making the definition of <span class="highlight">progress</span> metrics essential.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We set up a board and had our trio gathered once more to define what could tell us we did a good job with our email integration. We added our hypothesis to it, anticipating what we expected would change once our feature was released. Our suggestions for possible ways of measuring it meant to highlight more specific actions that could be observed, fueling discussion around what was the best way to do it, if they actually reflected what we were looking for and if there were any technical constraints we needed to be aware of when setting up our tracking. In the end, we were left with a few questions and action points each, making it a continuously developing source of truth as we progressed towards release and on.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Our main deliveries, after the process, were the very own board in which we collaborated (and would be adding/updating information as we learned more) and a metric dashboard in our event analytics tool displaying the progress metrics we had defined with our hypothesis pinned, building close ties to the data we observed and what it meant for our strategy. With the whole team committed to following up, we had a solid post-release strategy that resulted from great trio collaboration.
